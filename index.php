					<div class="grid">
						<h4 class="smallcaps">spiritual 
							formation</h4>
						<p>
							In an Anglican school, students and faculty are constantly being shaped, learning and imbibing moral virtues and the subject matter through imitation and habit, on the basis of daily worship, based on the traditional Books of Common Prayer (1662 & 1928).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid">
						<h4 class="smallcaps">inspired 
							education</h4>
						<p>
							Education is most effective when it is closely engaged with the life of the local parish, and an integral component and extension of a wholesome and devout family life, that is actively engaged in the community of an Anglican parish.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid">
						<h4 class="smallcaps">professional 
							faculty</h4>
						<p>
							In an Anglican school there is a reverence for normative Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. A Biblical curriculum teaches what is true, the Ten Commandments teach what is good, and a unified yearning for the divine teaches what is beautiful.
