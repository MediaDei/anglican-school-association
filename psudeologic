Notes:

The reason we switched to Static Home Page because of Hero Image
	- Index.php could not have a thumbnail because it was not a page
	- also, it made more since to use page-home.php since it is the default template for posts (we are using Notices page)

We are using the WP draft/publish functionality in all of our post types.
	- they are just not visible from the "page for widgets" screen
		- accessablie through the individual post types themeselves

------------------
Things left to do:

- Global
	- H3 circle images need to be coded to use thumbnail

	- Solve IMG positioning for thumbnails (hero imgs and framed image widgets)

	- H2 need narrow class to be applied by php strlen() or WYSIWYG Editor drop down. Which to use?

- Notices Page
	- New Filter/Post Loop PHP logic

- Resources Page
	- Allow user to upload files from dashboard and auto adjust date on button
		- make sure have the latest version of resources from live server

- Apply Page
	- Form JS Validation?

	- Should the two blue link sections be custom post type?

- Footer
	- Overlapping PNGs for Logos

	- Appearance cleanup

- Fixes:
	- check all labels for custom post types
		- Add new text to have "widget" included or not?

--------------------------

start
  default load: no checkboxes ever checked
  load all posts in respective divs
  hide/show divs based on input of checkboxes
  	pagination in each div
	when you click on a page link in pagination
		open archive php with that cat and page
end

create archive template; can use page notices
