Notes:

------------------
Things left to do:

- Global
	- Solve IMG positioning for thumbnails (hero imgs and framed image widgets)
		- Using Absolute positioning, working but not ideal
			- user can't upload images that are longer than they are wide or else they don't fill the width of the wrapper
			- Should we go back to dynamic height, were width always fit?

- Resources Page
	- WP Document Revision looks best for us
	- Start a Parish School Button does not link to anything
		- What should it link to/do?

- Apply Page
	- Form JS Validation?
